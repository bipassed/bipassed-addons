# bipassed addons

Adds a bunch of little things that don't deserve an entire mod slot on their own.
## REQUIRES [VANILLA EXPANDED FRAMEWORK](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1854607105)

## [Core](https://store.steampowered.com/app/294100/RimWorld/)
**Lobotomy:** Simple and fairly inexpensive way to stop a colonist or prisoner from complaining so much. Lowers consciousness by 30%, chance of death on failure is 100%. Causes chance of psychotic wander every 30 days or so if successful.

**Vertical Hydroponics:** Adds a 1x1 building that grows 4 plants in once space.

**Nutrient Slop:** Cheaper yet more foul version of nutrient paste. Turns 0.1 nutrition into 0.9, at the cost of a 15 day long -30 mood debuff. You have to be desperate or evil to willingly cook this.

**Cheaper Flagstone:** Changes the flagstone recipes from 4 to 2 stone blocks.

**Cheaper Bridges:** Reduces the price of all bridges from 12 to 6.

**Cheaper Carpet:** Reduces the price of carpet from 7 cloth to 6.

**Virtual Reality:** Adds in a recreational virtual reality headset made at a tailoring bench. Every 24 hours, the headset will drop 7% of the wearer's market value (as payment for hooking up to the intergalactic cyberspace), and completely fill the recreation gain. Wearing the headset provides random chance bonuses as well. These include:
- 1 in 60 to gain a small amount of experience in any given skill.
- 1 in 100 to temporarily boost moving, manipulation, or speech.
- 1 in 100 to be given a trait, with a following 80% for positive and 20% for negative.
- 1 in 100 to have a trait completely removed from the wearer.
- 1 in 100 to gain a 30-day +30 mood bonus.
- 1 in 500 to suffer a heart attack.

If **RimJobWorld** is active, an additional lewd headset is added which drops 14% of the wearer's market value, increases vulnerability, and fills the recreation bar, as well as the chance to provide the following effects per day:
- If **Sexperience** is active, 50/50 chance to gain experience in the sex skill.
- 1 in 100 to gain a 30-day +30 mood bonus.
- 1 in 200 to gain a random RimJobWorld trait.
- 1 in 400 to suffer a heart attack.
More to come when I add Milking Machine compatability.

Also adds a bed that refills the hunger need at the cost of 640w of electricity, made specifically for long-term use.

**One Million Silver Endgame:** If you save up one million silver, you can build the silver stash in the Ship architect menu. This is an immediate end-game winning scenario. Also incdlues a 250,000k silver ending in case you wanna do a shorter run.

## [Biotech](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1826140/RimWorld__Biotech/)
**Shortened implant recovery:** From 2 years to 15 days.

## [Vanilla Weapons Expanded - Non-Lethal](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2454918354)
**Non-Lethal Turrets:** Adds a single turret building that fires slightly faster and one extra bullet per burst at the cost of the bullets themselves being the same as the non-lethal pistol.

## [Vanilla Apparel Expanded](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1814987817)
**Arm and Leg Warmers:** An extra bit of cold protection, as well as just being aesthetically pleasing for lore relevancy. After all, can't have a femboy prisoner without thigh highs. If **Identity: Dysphoria** is active, both arm and leg warmers will provide a small femininity boost.

**Handwear and Footwear:** Children can wear them now!

## [Vanilla Furniture Expanded](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1718190143)
**Learning on Computers:** Gives the old and modern computers bills, allowing pawns to use them to learn new skills. Requires the pawn to be capable of research.

## [Vanilla Furniture Expanded - Architect](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2608762624)
**Cheaper Bridges:** Reduces the price of all bridges from 12 to 6.

## [Optimization: Meats - C# Edition](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2542931556)
**Vegetarian:** New trait. Gives pawns that eat raw or cooked animal meat a small mood debuff.

## [Anthrosoane](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2902258418)
**Transfurmation:** An ability that transforms a pawn into any random anthrosonae. If **RimJobWorld** is active, adds hypersexual trait and increases the size of private parts.

## [Capacity Deprivation and Prisoner Bindings Port](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2884504605)
**Slave Suppression Patch:** Adds a slave suppression offset to each of the bindings.

**Lifestage Support:** Children can wear them now.

## [Identity: Dysphoria](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2749597658)
**Balanced Transgender Thought:** Lowers the mood bonus of being affirming from 5, 8, 14, 25 to 2, 4, 7, 14

**If RimJobWorld is active, the following changes will be applied:**
- Removal of top surgery and associated
- RJW parts now provide benefits to MascStat and FemStat, depending on part

**NOTE:** The RimJobWorld patch will cause errors relating to no hediff found and no prerequisite found. These are **safe to ignore**. I'll attempt to fix one of the errors later.

## [Research Data](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3001121619)
**Analyzer Data Rebalance:** Increases the fuelConsumptionRate from 0.33 (3 days) to 0.066 (15 days). This is done because the analyzer data is still used even while nobody is researching.

## [Mines 2.0](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2503894706)
**Jewlery Patch:** Allows you to mine for the Jewlery ores like diamond, ruby, and sapphire.

## [Vanilla Nutrient Paste Expanded](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2920385763)
**Nutrient slop patch:** Patches the nutrient dripper and grinder to be more in line with this mod's Core nutrient slop. I tride making my own network and everything, but the dripper wouldn't connect to the bed, and the tap is hardcoded to produce nutrient paste. Thanks Oskar, for hiring people to make such a shitty framework that nobody can easily use! You obviously care about the modding scene as a whole. 

## [UnderWhere](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1870010563) 
**Gender-Neutral Underwear:** Makes all underwear gender-neutral. If **Identity: Dysphoria** is active, provides a small boost of masculinity and femininity to male and female underwear.

## [RimJobWorld](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/7257-rimjobworld/)
**Rapeshroom:** New drug made from 10 humpshroom and 1 neutroamine. Induces a near-constant random rape mental break for about a day. Why you would ever use this outside of religious or lore reasons is beyond me.

**Hyposexual:** New trait. Reduces sex drive to 0%.

**Ultrasexual:** New trait. Incrases sex drive to 1000%.

**Instinct Breeder:** New trait. Increases sex drive to 100000%.

## [RJW Sexperience](https://www.loverslab.com/topic/193448-mod-rjw-sexperience-continued/)
**Cum Is Okay:** Removes the optimalityOffsetHumanlikes and increases nutrition from 0.01 to 0.05.

# UNFINISHED - NOT WORKING

## [RimJobWorld](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/7257-rimjobworld/)
**Porn Camera:** Create a camera building that, for each pawn having sex in its radius, drops a sellable porn item. Pawn must be in radius of the camera to regenerate the urge to have sex. Optimal placements are in bedrooms.
Technically works, but only one on a map.

## [Milking Machine](https://github.com/bipassed/rjw-milking-machine)
**Galactorrhea Implant:** Induces a permanent lactation at a slight consciousness debuff.

## [Noobert Nebulous - Vidtuber](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3013420224)
**Lewd video tag:** Applying this tag will check the size of a pawn's bits and multiply the output of views and subscribers.

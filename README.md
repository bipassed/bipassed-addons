# bipassed addons

Adds a bunch of little things that don't deserve an entire mod slot on their own.
## [Core](https://store.steampowered.com/app/294100/RimWorld/)
**Lobotomy:** Simple and fairly inexpensive way to stop a colonist or prisoner from complaining so much. Lowers consciousness by 30%, chance of death on failure is 100%. Causes chance of berserk, psychotic wander and sad wander every 120 days or so if successful. **NOTE:** This gives a config error, it can be safely ignored.

**Vertical Hydroponics:** Adds a 1x1 building that grows 4 plants in once space.

**Nutrient Slop:** Cheaper yet more foul version of nutrient paste. Turns 0.1 nutrition into 0.9, at the cost of a 15 day long -30 mood debuff. You have to be desperate or evil to willingly cook this.

**Cheaper Flagstone:** Changes the flagstone recipes from 4 to 2 stone blocks.

**Cheaper Bridges:** Reduces the price of all bridges from 12 to 6.

## [Vanilla Weapons Expanded - Non-Lethal](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2454918354)
**Non-Lethal Turrets:** Adds a single turret building that fires slightly faster and one extra bullet per burst at the cost of the bullets themselves being the same as the non-lethal pistol.

## [Vanilla Apparel Expanded](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1814987817)
**Arm and Leg Warmers:** An extra bit of cold protection, as well as just being aesthetically pleasing for lore relevancy. After all, can't have a femboy prisoner without thigh highs. If **Identity: Dysphoria** is active, both arm and leg warmers will provide a small femininity boost.

**Handwear and Footwear:** Children can wear them now!

## [Vanilla Furniture Expanded](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1718190143)
**Learning on Computers:** Gives the old and modern computers bills, allowing pawns to use them to learn new skills. Requires the pawn to be capable of research.

## [Vanilla Furniture Expanded - Architect](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2608762624)
**Cheaper Bridges:** Reduces the price of all bridges from 12 to 6.

## [Optimization: Meats - C# Edition](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2542931556)
**Vegetarian:** New trait. Gives pawns that eat raw or cooked animal meat a small mood debuff.

## [Capacity Deprivation and Prisoner Bindings Port](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2884504605)
**Slave Suppression Patch:** Adds a slave suppression offset to each of the bindings.

## [Identity: Dysphoria](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2749597658)
**Balanced Transgender Thought:** Lowers the mood bonus of being affirming from 5, 8, 14, 25 to 2, 4, 7, 14

**If RimJobWorld is active, the following changes will be applied:**
- Removal of top surgery and associated
- RJW parts now provide benefits to MascStat and FemStat, depending on part

**NOTE:** The RimJobWorld patch will cause errors relating to no hediff found and no prerequisite found. These are **safe to ignore**. I'll attempt to fix one of the errors later.

## [UnderWhere](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1870010563) 
**Gender-Neutral Underwear:** Makes all underwear gender-neutral. If **Identity: Dysphoria** is active, provides a small boost of masculinity and femininity to male and female underwear.

## [RimJobWorld](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/7257-rimjobworld/)
**Rapeshroom:** New drug made from 10 humpshroom and 1 neutroamine. Induces a near-constant random rape mental break for about a day. Why you would ever use this outside of religious or lore reasons is beyond me.

**Hyposexual:** New trait. Reduces sex drive to 0%.

**Ultrasexual:** New trait. Incrases sex drive to 1000%.

**Instinct Breeder:** New trait. Increases sex drive to 100000%.

## [Milking Machine](https://github.com/bipassed/rjw-milking-machine)
**Galactorrhea Implant:** Induces a permanent lactation at a slight consciousness debuff.

# bipassed addons
 Adds a bunch of little things that don't deserve an entire mod slot on their own.

## [Core](https://store.steampowered.com/app/294100/RimWorld/)

**Lobotomy:** Simple and fairly inexpensive way to stop a colonist or prisoner from complaining so much. Chance of death, 25%.

**Nutrient Slop:** Cheaper yet more foul version of nutrient paste. Turns 0.1 nutrition into 0.9, at the cost of a 15 day long -30 mood debuff. You have to be desperate or evil to willingly cook this.

**Cheaper Flagstone:** Changes the flagstone recipes from 4 to 2 stone blocks.

## [Vanilla Weapons Expanded - Non-Lethal](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2454918354)
 
 **Non-Lethal Turrets:** Adds a single turret building that fires slightly faster and one extra bullet per burst at the cost of the bullets themselves being the same as the non-lethal pistol.

## [Vanilla Apparel Expanded](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1814987817)

 **Arm and Leg Warmers:** An extra bit of cold protection, as well as just being aesthetically pleasing for lore relevancy. After all, can't have a femboy prisoner without thigh highs.

## [Vanilla Furniture Expanded](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1718190143)

**Learning on Computers:** Gives the old and modern computers bills, allowing pawns to use them to learn new skills. Requires the pawn to be capable of research.

## [Capacity Deprivation and Prisoner Bindings Port](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2884504605)

**Slave Suppression Patch:** Adds a slave suppression offset to each of the bindings.

## [Identity: Dysphoria](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2749597658)

**Balanced Transgender Thought:** Lowers the mood bonus of being affirming from 5, 8, 14, 25 to 2, 4, 7, 14

**If RimJobWorld is active, the following changes will be applied:**
- Removal of top surgery and associated
- RJW parts now provide benefits to MascStat and FemStat, depending on part

**NOTE:** The RimJobWorld patch will cause errors relating to no hediff found and no prerequisite found. These are **safe to ignore**. I'll attempt to fix one of the errors later.

## [RimJobWorld](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/7257-rimjobworld/)

**Rapeshroom:** New drug made from 10 humpshroom and 1 neutroamine. Induces a near-constant random rape mental break for about a day. Why you would ever use this outside of religious or lore reasons is beyond me.

 Adds a bunch of little things that don't deserve an entire mod slot on their own.

## Core
**Lobotomy:** Simple and fairly inexpensive way to stop a colonist or prisoner from complaining so much. Chance of death, 25%.
**Nutrient Slop:** Cheaper yet more foul version of nutrient paste. Turns 0.1 nutrition into 0.9, at the cost of a 15 day long -30 mood debuff. You have to be desperate or evil to willingly cook this.

 ## [Vanilla Weapons Expanded - Non-Lethal](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2454918354)
 
 **Non-Lethal Turrets:** Adds a single turret building that fires slightly faster and one extra bullet per burst at the cost of the bullets themselves being the same as the non-lethal pistol.
 ## [Vanilla Apparel Expanded](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1814987817)
 
 **Arm and Leg Warmers:** An extra bit of cold protection, as well as just being aesthetically pleasing for lore relevancy. After all, can't have a femboy prisoner without thigh highs.

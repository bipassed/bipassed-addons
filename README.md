# bipassed addons

Adds a bunch of little things that don't deserve an entire mod slot on their own.
## REQUIRES [VANILLA EXPANDED FRAMEWORK](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1854607105)

## [Core](https://store.steampowered.com/app/294100/RimWorld/)
**Lobotomy:** Simple and fairly inexpensive way to stop a colonist or prisoner from complaining so much. Lowers consciousness by 30%, chance of death on failure is 100%. Causes chance of psychotic wander every 30 days or so if successful.

**Vertical Hydroponics:** Adds a 1x1 building that grows 4 plants in once space.

**Nutrient Slop:** Cheaper yet more foul version of nutrient paste. Turns 0.1 nutrition into 0.9, at the cost of a 15 day long -30 mood debuff. You have to be desperate or evil to willingly cook this.

**Cheaper Flagstone:** Changes the flagstone recipes from 4 to 2 stone blocks.

**Cheaper Bridges:** Reduces the price of all bridges from 12 to 6.

**Cheaper Carpet:** Reduces the price of carpet from 7 cloth to 6.

**Virtual Reality:** Adds in a recreational virtual reality headset made at a tailoring bench. Every 24 hours, the headset will drop 7% of the wearer's market value (as payment for hooking up to the intergalactic cyberspace), and completely fill the recreation gain. Wearing the headset provides random chance bonuses as well. These include:
- 1 in 60 to gain a small amount of experience in any given skill.
- 1 in 100 to temporarily boost moving, manipulation, or speech.
- 1 in 100 to be given a trait, with a following 80% for positive and 20% for negative.
- 1 in 100 to have a trait completely removed from the wearer.
- 1 in 100 to gain a 30-day +30 mood bonus.
- 1 in 500 to suffer a heart attack.

If **RimJobWorld** is active, an additional lewd headset is added which drops 14% of the wearer's market value, increases vulnerability, and fills the recreation bar, as well as the chance to provide the following effects per day:
- If **Sexperience** is active, 50/50 chance to gain experience in the sex skill.
- 1 in 100 to gain a 30-day +30 mood bonus.
- 1 in 200 to gain a random RimJobWorld trait.
- 1 in 400 to suffer a heart attack.
More to come when I add Milking Machine compatability.

Also adds a bed that refills the hunger need at the cost of 640w of electricity, made specifically for long-term use.

**One Million Silver Endgame:** If you save up one million silver, you can build the silver stash in the Ship architect menu. This is an immediate end-game winning scenario.

## [Vanilla Weapons Expanded - Non-Lethal](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2454918354)
**Non-Lethal Turrets:** Adds a single turret building that fires slightly faster and one extra bullet per burst at the cost of the bullets themselves being the same as the non-lethal pistol.

## [Vanilla Apparel Expanded](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1814987817)
**Arm and Leg Warmers:** An extra bit of cold protection, as well as just being aesthetically pleasing for lore relevancy. After all, can't have a femboy prisoner without thigh highs. If **Identity: Dysphoria** is active, both arm and leg warmers will provide a small femininity boost.

**Handwear and Footwear:** Children can wear them now!

## [Vanilla Furniture Expanded](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1718190143)
**Learning on Computers:** Gives the old and modern computers bills, allowing pawns to use them to learn new skills. Requires the pawn to be capable of research.

## [Vanilla Furniture Expanded - Architect](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2608762624)
**Cheaper Bridges:** Reduces the price of all bridges from 12 to 6.

## [Optimization: Meats - C# Edition](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2542931556)
**Vegetarian:** New trait. Gives pawns that eat raw or cooked animal meat a small mood debuff.

## [Capacity Deprivation and Prisoner Bindings Port](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2884504605)
**Slave Suppression Patch:** Adds a slave suppression offset to each of the bindings.

## [Identity: Dysphoria](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2749597658)
**Balanced Transgender Thought:** Lowers the mood bonus of being affirming from 5, 8, 14, 25 to 2, 4, 7, 14

**If RimJobWorld is active, the following changes will be applied:**
- Removal of top surgery and associated
- RJW parts now provide benefits to MascStat and FemStat, depending on part

**NOTE:** The RimJobWorld patch will cause errors relating to no hediff found and no prerequisite found. These are **safe to ignore**. I'll attempt to fix one of the errors later.

## [Research Data](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3001121619)
**Analyzer Data Rebalance:** Increases the fuelConsumptionRate from 0.33 (3 days) to 0.066 (15 days). This is done because the analyzer data is still used even while nobody is researching.

## [UnderWhere](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1870010563) 
**Gender-Neutral Underwear:** Makes all underwear gender-neutral. If **Identity: Dysphoria** is active, provides a small boost of masculinity and femininity to male and female underwear.

## [RimJobWorld](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/7257-rimjobworld/)
**Rapeshroom:** New drug made from 10 humpshroom and 1 neutroamine. Induces a near-constant random rape mental break for about a day. Why you would ever use this outside of religious or lore reasons is beyond me.

**Recording Porn:** New apparel made at a machining table. Equip it and have sex to record porn! Drops porn USB sticks that can be sold to pretty much any trader. If **Sexperience** is active, the quality of the porn relies on the sex skill. Otherwise, it relies on social.
**NOTE:** Currently broken, drops more than it should and I don't know why.

**Hyposexual:** New trait. Reduces sex drive to 0%.

**Ultrasexual:** New trait. Incrases sex drive to 1000%.

**Instinct Breeder:** New trait. Increases sex drive to 100000%.

## [RJW Sexperience]()
**Cum Is Okay:** Removes the optimalityOffsetHumanlikes and increases nutrition from 0.01 to 0.05.

## [Milking Machine](https://github.com/bipassed/rjw-milking-machine)
**Galactorrhea Implant:** Induces a permanent lactation at a slight consciousness debuff. **NOT FINISHED YET**

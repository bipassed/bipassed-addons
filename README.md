 Adds a bunch of little things that don't deserve an entire mod slot on their own.
 ## Non-Lethal Turrets
 REQUIRES: [Vanilla Weapons Expanded - Non-Lethal](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2454918354)
 
 Adds non-lethal turrets that shoot the same projectile the pistol does. Rubber bullets.
 ## Arm Warmers and Thigh Highs
 REQUIRES: [Vanilla Apparel Expanded](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1814987817)

 Adds arm warmers and thigh highs. You need your prisoners to be femboyed, obviously.
